Analysis of House Pricing Dataset (Kaggle Competition 2016)

INTRODUCTION

Data mining is the process of finding patterns within the large datasets. It is a process of finding correlations and anomalies to predict the outcomes. Data Mining and Machine learning are related to each other. While performing machine learning algorithms such as random forest, decision tree, we tend to perform data mining as well. In the present assignment, we are trying to perform data mining through random forest and decision tree. The dataset which has been taken contains the information about the house pricing and includes multiple variables affecting it. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this link https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data


ABOUT THE DATASET

In the present assignment, we have taken House Pricing dataset. This dataset is one of the Kaggle Competition datasets. The dataset contains information about house pricing and the variables affecting it. The dataset is divided into 2 parts: train dataset and test dataset. The combined dataset has 2919 rows in total and 81 column variables out of which 79 are explanatory variables describing every aspect of the residential home.  
     

GOAL / OBJECTIVE

In this assignment, we are trying to predict the house prices, so SalePrice is the response variable here while other 79 column variables are predictors. The goal or objective is to perform some data mining techniques and do the exploratory data analysis. After that, predictive modeling techniques such as random forest and decision tree are to be performed to predict the SalePrice of the houses.


EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

In order to explore the data, we have used a library known as Data Explorer library. It helps in easy EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). EDA refers to the process of summarizing and analyzing the data sets as per their characteristics and often involves visual methods. It is a process of carefully observing the data and what the data tell us beyond modeling or hypothesis testing. With the help of Data Explorer library, we have created various charts which can be observed in the code file.


OUTPUT / PREDICTION
The output i.e. the prediction of house prices is contained in a csv file named House_Prices.csv attached in the repository.
